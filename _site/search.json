    "text": "What are the driving forces behind urban dwellers to weak up early in morning to commute from their home locations to their work places? What are the impact of removing a public bus service on the commuters reside along the corridor of the bus route? These and many other questions related to urban mobility are challenges faced by transport operators and urban managers.\nTo provide answer to this question, traditionally, commuters survey will be used. However, commuters survey is a very costly, time-consuming and laborous, not to mention that the survey data tend to take a long time to clean and analyse. As a result, it is not unusual, by the time the survey report was ready, most of the information already out-of-date!\nAs city-wide urban infrastructures such as public buses, mass rapid transits, public utilities and roads become digital, the data sets obtained can be used as a framework for tracking movement patterns through space and time. This is particularly true with the recent trend of massive deployment of pervasive computing technologies such as GPS on the vehicles and SMART cards used by public transport commuters.\nUnfortunately, this explosive growth of geospatially-referenced data has far outpaced the planner’s ability to utilize and transform the data into insightful information thus creating an adverse impact on the return on the investment made to collect and manage this data."

The absence of labels, compounded by the use of a violin plot that highlights distribution, adds to the complexity.\n\n“…Noteworthy is the discernible uptick in both unit price and transaction volume from January to March 2024…”\n\nTransaction volume is particularly challenging to discern compared to unit price because the y-axis is focused on describing unit prices.\n\n“…Despite an overall reduction in total transactions vis-a-vis the preceding year, there is an unmistakable trend towards growth within specific sub-markets, suggesting an increasing inclination towards higher-value properties…”\n\nThe x-axis represents the three months of Q1 2024 instead of displaying transaction volume, a metric frequently referenced by the author. Utilizing the x-axis to depict transaction volume would enhance clarity significantly..\n\nOther concerns:\nThe title provides a general description but lacks specificity. It does not specify the time period covered by the visualization, nor does it offer insight into the context or main focus of the visualization. A more detailed title and subtitle would enhance clarity and understanding for the audience.\nThe x-axis represents the three months of Q1 2024 instead of displaying transaction volume, a metric frequently referenced by the author. Utilizing the x-axis to depict transaction volume would enhance clarity significantly.\n\n\n\n2.2.2 Aesthetics\n\nThe color selection is problematic due to the light-colored background, which matches the hue of the violin plot. This makes it strenuous for the eyes to distinguish between elements.\nFonts, titles, x-ticks, and legends are small and difficult to discern."

In this case, the use of a violin plot is worse as the writer intends to make several comparisons that are not obvious from said plot.\nThis scenario seems appropriate for a similar makeover done by Michael Djohan for another student.\nAcknowledging that point plots may distract and add little value, we omitted them. Instead, a modified bar chart resembling a violin plot was adopted. This alternative retains the visual appeal of a violin plot while providing clearer and more informative comparisons. We also decided to add annotations for median prices and transaction volume. A facet plot is used to distinctively compare between the three months for Q1 2024."

    "text": "What are the driving forces behind urban dwellers to weak up early in morning to commute from their home locations to their work places? What are the impact of removing a public bus service on the commuters reside along the corridor of the bus route? These and many other questions related to urban mobility are challenges faced by transport operators and urban managers.\nTo provide answer to this question, traditionally, commuters survey will be used. However, commuters survey is a very costly, time-consuming and laborous, not to mention that the survey data tend to take a long time to clean and analyse. As a result, it is not unusual, by the time the survey report was ready, most of the information already out-of-date!\nAs city-wide urban infrastructures such as public buses, mass rapid transits, public utilities and roads become digital, the data sets obtained can be used as a framework for tracking movement patterns through space and time. This is particularly true with the recent trend of massive deployment of pervasive computing technologies such as GPS on the vehicles and SMART cards used by public transport commuters.\nUnfortunately, this explosive growth of geospatially-referenced data has far outpaced the planner’s ability to utilize and transform the data into insightful information thus creating an adverse impact on the return on the investment made to collect and manage this data."

The absence of labels, compounded by the use of a violin plot that highlights distribution, adds to the complexity.\n\n“…Noteworthy is the discernible uptick in both unit price and transaction volume from January to March 2024…”\n\nTransaction volume is particularly challenging to discern compared to unit price because the y-axis is focused on describing unit prices.\n\n“…Despite an overall reduction in total transactions vis-a-vis the preceding year, there is an unmistakable trend towards growth within specific sub-markets, suggesting an increasing inclination towards higher-value properties…”\n\nThe x-axis represents the three months of Q1 2024 instead of displaying transaction volume, a metric frequently referenced by the author. Utilizing the x-axis to depict transaction volume would enhance clarity significantly..\n\nOther concerns:\nThe title provides a general description but lacks specificity. It does not specify the time period covered by the visualization, nor does it offer insight into the context or main focus of the visualization. A more detailed title and subtitle would enhance clarity and understanding for the audience.\nThe x-axis represents the three months of Q1 2024 instead of displaying transaction volume, a metric frequently referenced by the author. Utilizing the x-axis to depict transaction volume would enhance clarity significantly.\n\n\n\n2.2.2 Aesthetics\n\nThe color selection is problematic due to the light-colored background, which matches the hue of the violin plot. This makes it strenuous for the eyes to distinguish between elements.\nFonts, titles, x-ticks, and legends are small and difficult to discern."

In this case, the use of a violin plot is worse as the writer intends to make several comparisons that are not obvious from said plot.\nThis scenario seems appropriate for a similar makeover done by Michael Djohan for another student.\nAcknowledging that point plots may distract and add little value, we omitted them. Instead, a modified bar chart resembling a violin plot was adopted. This alternative retains the visual appeal of a violin plot while providing clearer and more informative comparisons. We also decided to add annotations for median prices and transaction volume. A facet plot is used to distinctively compare between the three months for Q1 2024."

The absence of labels, compounded by the use of a violin plot that highlights distribution, adds to the complexity.\n\n“…Noteworthy is the discernible uptick in both unit price and transaction volume from January to March 2024…”\n\nTransaction volume is particularly challenging to discern compared to unit price because the y-axis is focused on describing unit prices.\n\n“…Despite an overall reduction in total transactions vis-a-vis the preceding year, there is an unmistakable trend towards growth within specific sub-markets, suggesting an increasing inclination towards higher-value properties…”\n\nThe x-axis represents the three months of Q1 2024 instead of displaying transaction volume, a metric frequently referenced by the author. Utilizing the x-axis to depict transaction volume would enhance clarity significantly..\n\nOther concerns:\nThe title provides a general description but lacks specificity. It does not specify the time period covered by the visualization, nor does it offer insight into the context or main focus of the visualization. A more detailed title and subtitle would enhance clarity and understanding for the audience.\nThe x-axis represents the three months of Q1 2024 instead of displaying transaction volume, a metric frequently referenced by the author.

In this case, the use of a violin plot is worse as the writer intends to make several comparisons that are not obvious from said plot.\nThis scenario seems appropriate for a similar makeover done by Michael Djohan for another student.\nAcknowledging that point plots may distract and add little value, we omitted them. Instead, a modified bar chart resembling a violin plot was adopted. This alternative retains the visual appeal of a violin plot while providing clearer and more informative comparisons. We also decided to add annotations for median prices and transaction volume. A facet plot is used to distinctively compare between the three months for Q1 2024."

What are the impact of removing a public bus service on the commuters reside along the corridor of the bus route? These and many other questions related to urban mobility are challenges faced by transport operators and urban managers.\nTo provide answer to this question, traditionally, commuters survey will be used. However, commuters survey is a very costly, time-consuming and laborous, not to mention that the survey data tend to take a long time to clean and analyse. As a result, it is not unusual, by the time the survey report was ready, most of the information already out-of-date!\nAs city-wide urban infrastructures such as public buses, mass rapid transits, public utilities and roads become digital, the data sets obtained can be used as a framework for tracking movement patterns through space and time. This is particularly true with the recent trend of massive deployment of pervasive computing technologies such as GPS on the vehicles and SMART cards used by public transport commuters.\nUnfortunately, this explosive growth of geospatially-referenced data has far outpaced the planner’s ability to utilize and transform the data into insightful information thus creating an adverse impact on the return on the investment made to collect and manage this data."

Instead, a modified bar chart resembling a violin plot was adopted. This alternative retains the visual appeal of a violin plot while providing clearer and more informative comparisons.

Firstly, we realize that we construct our desired plot we need our Unit Price ($ PSF)to be categorized into bins as Unit_Price_Bin\n\n\nShow the code\n# Creating bins\nbreaks &lt;- c(750, 1000, 1250, 1500, 1750, 2000, 2250, 2500, 2750, 3000, 3250, 3500, 3750, 4000)\n\nfiltered_data &lt;- filtered_data %&gt;%\n  filter(!is.na(`Unit Price ($ PSF)`)) %&gt;%\n  filter(`Unit Price ($ PSF)` &lt;= 4000) %&gt;%\n  mutate(Unit_Price_Bin = cut(`Unit Price ($ PSF)`, \n                              breaks = breaks, \n                              labels = c(\"751-1000\", \"1001-1250\", \"1251-1500\", \"1501-1750\", \"1751-2000\", \"2001-2250\", \"2251-2500\", \"2501-2750\", \"2751-3000\", \"3001-3250\", \"3251-3500\", \"3501-3750\", \"3751-4000\"), \n                              include.lowest = TRUE,\n                              right = FALSE)) %&gt;%\n  filter(!is.na(Unit_Price_Bin))\n\n\nWe save our processed data into .rds data format files using the write_rds() of readr package. The output file is saved in rds sub-folder.

It calculates the count of transactions (Count) and assigns negative values to transactions related to apartments (Trans_Vol) to prepare for a pyramid chart.\n\n\nShow the code\n# Creating base data for pyramid\nbase_data &lt;- filtered_data %&gt;%\n  group_by(Month_Sale_Data, Unit_Price_Bin, `Property Type`) %&gt;%\n  summarise(Count = n()) %&gt;%\n  ungroup() %&gt;%\n  mutate(Trans_Vol = ifelse(`Property Type` == \"Apartment\", Count * (-1), Count))\n\n\n\n\nMedian Unit Price Calculation:\nIt computes the median unit price (median_unit_price) for each month and property type combination, adjusting the values for apartments to negative if necessary.\n\n\nShow the code\n# median Unit Price\nUnitPrice_median &lt;- filtered_data %&gt;%\n  group_by(Month_Sale_Data, `Property Type`) %&gt;%\n  summarise(median_unit_price = median(`Unit Price ($ PSF)`)) %&gt;%\n  mutate(median_unit_price = ifelse(`Property Type` == \"Apartment\", median_unit_price * (-1), median_unit_price)) %&gt;%\n  ungroup()\n\n\n\n\nTransaction Volume Aggregation:\nThe code calculates the maximum and minimum transaction volumes (max_vol, min_vol) for each month and property type, as well as the total transaction volume for each month (sum_transvolume_month).\n\n# transvolume_maxmin as transaction volume by month\ntransvolume_maxmin &lt;- base_data %&gt;%\n  group_by(Month_Sale_Data,`Property Type`) %&gt;%\n  summarise(max_vol = max(abs(Trans_Vol)),\n            min_vol = min(abs(Trans_Vol))) %&gt;%\n  ungroup()\n\n# transvolume_month as total volume by month \ntransvolume_month &lt;- base_data %&gt;%\n  group_by(Month_Sale_Data) %&gt;%\n  summarise(sum_transvolume_month = sum(abs(Trans_Vol))) %&gt;% \n  ungroup()\n\n\n\nTotal Transaction Volume by Property Type:\nIt determines the total transaction volume for each unit price bin and property type combination (sum_transvolume_property).\n\n# transvolume_property as total transaction volume by property type\ntransvolume_property &lt;- base_data %&gt;%\n  group_by(Unit_Price_Bin, `Property Type`) %&gt;%\n  summarise(sum_transvolume_property = sum(Trans_Vol)) %&gt;%\n  ungroup()\n\n\n\nJoining Tables\n\n# joining multiple tables\ntransaction_data &lt;- base_data %&gt;%\n  left_join(transvolume_maxmin, by = c('Month_Sale_Data', 'Property Type')) %&gt;%\n  left_join(transvolume_month, by = 'Month_Sale_Data') %&gt;%\n  left_join(transvolume_property, by = c('Unit_Price_Bin', 'Property Type')) %&gt;%\n  left_join(UnitPrice_median, by = c('Month_Sale_Data', 'Property Type'))\n\ntransaction_data$Unit_Price_Bin &lt;- factor(transaction_data$Unit_Price_Bin, exclude = NULL)\n\n\n\nSignal Creation:\nThe code generates signals (signal, signal1) to indicate whether a transaction volume or median unit price falls within certain ranges, differentiating between property types. These signals are based on conditions comparing transaction volumes and median unit prices with predefined ranges.\n\n\nShow the code\ntransaction_data &lt;- transaction_data %&gt;%\n   mutate(signal = case_when((min_vol == abs(Trans_Vol) | max_vol == abs(Trans_Vol)) & `Property Type` == \"Apartment\" ~ -1,\n                             (min_vol == abs(Trans_Vol) | max_vol == abs(Trans_Vol)) & `Property Type` == \"Condominium\" ~ 1, TRUE~0)) %&gt;%\n\n# Assuming `Unit_Price_Bin` is a factor with ordered levels representing price ranges\n\nmutate(signal1 = case_when(\n    `Property Type` == \"Apartment\" & abs(median_unit_price) &gt;= as.numeric(sub(\"\\\\-(\\\\d+)$\", \"\", Unit_Price_Bin)) & \n    abs(median_unit_price) &lt;= as.numeric(sub(\"^\\\\d+\\\\-\", \"\", Unit_Price_Bin)) ~ -1,\n    \n    `Property Type` == \"Condominium\" & abs(median_unit_price) &gt;= as.numeric(sub(\"\\\\-(\\\\d+)$\", \"\", Unit_Price_Bin)) & \n    abs(median_unit_price) &lt;= as.numeric(sub(\"^\\\\d+\\\\-\", \"\", Unit_Price_Bin)) ~ 1,\n    \n    TRUE ~ 0\n))\n\n\n#Order factors\ntransaction_data$`Property Type` &lt;- fct_relevel(transaction_data$`Property Type`, \"Apartment\")\ntransaction_data$Unit_Price_Bin  &lt;- fct_relevel(transaction_data$Unit_Price_Bin, \"751-1000\", \"1001-1250\")"

    "text": "What are the driving forces behind urban dwellers to weak up early in morning to commute from their home locations to their work places? What are the impact of removing a public bus service on the commuters reside along the corridor of the bus route? These and many other questions related to urban mobility are challenges faced by transport operators and urban managers.\nTo provide answer to this question, traditionally, commuters survey will be used. However, commuters survey is a very costly, time-consuming and laborous, not to mention that the survey data tend to take a long time to clean and analyse. As a result, it is not unusual, by the time the survey report was ready, most of the information already out-of-date!\nAs city-wide urban infrastructures such as public buses, mass rapid transits, public utilities and roads become digital, the data sets obtained can be used as a framework for tracking movement patterns through space and time. This is particularly true with the recent trend of massive deployment of pervasive computing technologies such as GPS on the vehicles and SMART cards used by public transport commuters.\nUnfortunately, this explosive growth of geospatially-referenced data has far outpaced the planner’s ability to utilize and transform the data into insightful information thus creating an adverse impact on the return on the investment made to collect and manage this data."

    "text": "Exploring the dataset\nThis Python code snippet uses TensorFlow’s Keras API to load the CIFAR-10 dataset and print the shapes of the training and test sets. The CIFAR-10 dataset is a popular dataset used for training machine learning and computer vision algorithms. It consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, with 6,000 images per class.\n\n# Load the CIFAR-10 dataset\ncifar10 = tf.keras.datasets.cifar10\n(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = cifar10.load_data()\n\nprint(\"Training set shape:\", x_train.shape)\nprint(\"Test set shape:\", x_test.shape)\n\n\n\n\nThe x_train.shape returns (50000, 32, 32, 3), indicating that there are 50,000 training images, each of size 32x32 pixels with 3 color channels (RGB).\nThe x_test.shape returns (10000, 32, 32, 3), indicating that there are 10,000 test images, each of size 32x32 pixels with 3 color channels (RGB).\n\n\nThis code will display the first 10 images from the CIFAR-10 training set with their respective classes.\n\nimages = range(0,10)\nclasses = list(np.unique(y_train))\nplt.figure(figsize=(20,10))\nfor i in images:\n        plt.subplot(2,5,1 + i).set_title(classes[y_train[i][0]])\n        plt.imshow(x_train[i])\n\n\nNext, let’s reshape the arrays to have only 2 dimensions\n\nx_train = x_train.reshape(50000, 32 * 32 * 3)\nx_test  = x_test.reshape (10000, 32 * 32 * 3)\n\nprint(\"Training set shape:\", x_train.shape)\nprint(\"Test set shape:\", x_test.shape)\n\n\n\nBy reshaping the images into (50000, 3072) and (10000, 3072), each image is now represented as a 1-dimensional array (vector) of length 3072. This reshaping is commonly done to prepare the data for certain machine learning algorithms that expect input as 1-dimensional arrays rather than 3-dimensional images.\n\nNext we perform the necessary pre-processing steps:\nSplitting the Training Dataset: The training dataset is split into a new training set and a validation set using an 80/20 split to evaluate the model during training. The train_test_split function is used with test_size=0.2 and random_state=42 for reproducibility.\nData Type Conversion: The feature arrays are converted to float32 data type to ensure compatibility with TensorFlow\n\n## Splitting \"training\" dataset further into train,validation datasets\nx_train, x_valid, y_train, y_valid = train_test_split(x_train, y_train, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)\n\nx_train = x_train.astype('float32')\nx_valid = x_valid.astype('float32')\nx_test = x_test.astype('float32')\n\nMin-Max Scaling: . A Min-Max scaling function normalizes the pixel values of the images to the range [0, 1], which helps in faster and more stable training of the model.\n\n## Transform method: MinMax - is preferred when working with TensorFlow\ndef min_max_scaler(x_train, x_valid, x_test):\n  x_train_ms= x_train/255\n  x_valid_ms= x_valid/255\n  x_test_ms = x_test/255\n  return x_train_ms,x_valid_ms,x_test_ms\n\nx_train_ms, x_valid_ms, x_test_ms = min_max_scaler(x_train, x_valid, x_test)\n\nOne-Hot Encoding the Labels: The class labels are converted to one-hot encoded vectors using to_categorical, which transforms the integer labels into binary vectors. This format is required for categorical classification tasks where the neural network’s output layer expects binary vectors.\n\n# By converting the target variables to one-hot format, we can ensure that they are compatible with the output layer of the MLP model, which expects the target variables to be represented as a vector of binary values.\ny_train_1hot = to_categorical(y_train, 10)\ny_valid_1hot = to_categorical(y_valid, 10)\ny_test_1hot  = to_categorical(y_test , 10)"

    "text": "2. Implementing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for CIFAR-10 Classification\nPreprocessing\nFirst off, let’s reproduce some of the preprocessing steps we did earlier:\n\n# Load Data and Split into Train, Test dataset\n(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = cifar10.load_data()\n\n# Onehot Encoding\ny_train = to_categorical(y_train, 10)\ny_test  = to_categorical(y_test , 10)\n\n# Convert to float datatype\nx_train = x_train.astype('float32')\nx_test  = x_test.astype('float32')\n\n# Minmax Scaling\nx_train  /= 255\nx_test   /= 255\n\nData Augmentation, Manual Splitting and Batch Processing\nNext, this set of additional steps are required for preprocessing for CNN\n\n# Data Augmentation\ntransform_train = ImageDataGenerator(\n        width_shift_range=0.1,  # randomly shift images horizontally (fraction of total width)\n        height_shift_range=0.1,  # randomly shift images vertically (fraction of total height)\n        rotation_range = 10,\n        horizontal_flip=True)   # flip images horizontally\n\nvalidation_train = ImageDataGenerator()\n\n# Split Train dataset to get Validation dataset\nvalidation_train = ImageDataGenerator()\ntrain_set = transform_train.flow(x_train[:40000], y_train[:40000], batch_size=32)\nvalidation_set = validation_train.flow(x_train[40000:], y_train[40000:], batch_size=32)\n\n\nWhy do we need additional preprocessing steps for CNN?\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are specifically designed to work with image data. To enhance their performance, particularly when working with relatively small datasets like CIFAR-10, additional preprocessing steps are often employed. These steps help improve the model’s ability to generalize to unseen data and mitigate overfitting.\n\nData Augmentation: Increases the diversity of the training dataset by applying random transformations such as shifts, rotations, and flips. This helps the CNN model generalize better by training on a wider variety of image presentations. This is different from MLP earlier as MLPs typically work with flattened input data and do not benefit as much from spatial data augmentation\nManual Splitting and Batch Processing: The ImageDataGenerator in TensorFlow/Keras handles data augmentation and requires the data to be in a specific format (i.e., batches). Hence, the split is done manually to apply augmentation on the training set while keeping the validation set unchanged. CNNs typically require batch processing for efficient training. The flow method from ImageDataGeneratorcreates an iterator that generates batches of augmented data on-the-fly. This is especially useful when working with large datasets or when applying data augmentation. Manual splitting allows for better control over how data is augmented and fed into the model. By explicitly defining the training and validation datasets, we ensure that augmentation is applied only to the training data, not the validation data.\n\n\n\nBuilding a Convolutional Neural Network for CIFAR-10!\n\nBatch Size: 64\nEpochs: 50\nPadding: Same\nKernel: 3*3\n(Convolution-BatchNormalisation-Relu-MaxPooling) x 2\nLoss Function: Categorical Crossentropy\nDropout: 0.25,0.25,0.5\n\n\nPadding: Same: This means that the output spatial dimensions will be the same as the input spatial dimensions after applying the convolution operation. This is achieved by adding zeros around the borders of the input tensor so that the output spatial dimensions match the input spatial dimensions.\n\n\nKernel: 3x3: A kernel size of 3x3 is a standard choice for convolutional neural networks because it provides a good balance between capturing local patterns and not overfitting to the training data. Larger kernel sizes can capture more complex patterns but may lead to overfitting, while smaller kernel sizes may not capture enough information.\n\n\n(Convolution-BatchNormalisation-Relu-MaxPooling) x 2: This sequence of layers is commonly used in convolutional neural networks because it allows the model to learn increasingly complex features while reducing overfitting.\n\n\nBatch normalization normalize the activations to improve generalization\n\n\nReLU activation functions introduce non-linearity to the model\n\n\nMax pooling layers downsample the spatial dimensions to reduce computational complexity and help the model learn spatial hierarchies.\n\n\nLoss Function: Categorical Crossentropy: This loss function is commonly used for multi-class classification problems like image classification. It measures the difference between the predicted probabilities and the true labels by calculating the negative log likelihood of the true class. This encourages the model to output high probabilities for the correct classes and low probabilities for the incorrect classe\n\n\nDropout is a regularization technique that helps prevent overfitting by randomly setting some of the neurons to zero during training. By using a high dropout rate (0.25) and (0.5), it is likely to reduce overfitting and contribute to better performance.\n\n## CNN Archeticure\ndef CNN():\n\n    model = Sequential()\n    model.add(Conv2D(32, (3, 3), padding='same', input_shape=x_train.shape[1:]) )\n    model.add(Activation('relu'))\n\n    model.add(Conv2D(32,(3, 3)))\n    model.add(BatchNormalization())\n    model.add(Activation('relu'))\n    model.add(MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2)))\n    model.add(Dropout(0.25))\n\n    model.add(Conv2D(32,(3, 3)))\n    model.add(BatchNormalization())\n    model.add(Activation('relu'))\n    model.add(MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2)))\n    model.add(Dropout(0.25))\n\n    model.add(Flatten())\n\n    model.add(Dense(512))\n    model.add(BatchNormalization())\n    model.add(Activation('relu'))\n    model.add(Dropout(0.5))\n\n    model.add(Dense(10))\n    model.add(Activation('softmax'))\n\n\n\n# Train model\n    model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'])\n    return model\n\ncnn = CNN()\n\n\ncnn.fit(train_set,\n        epochs=50,\n        batch_size=64,\n        validation_data=validation_set, shuffle=True)\n\nloss, acc = cnn.evaluate(x_test, y_test, verbose=1)\nprint('Test loss:', loss)\nprint('Test acc:', acc)"

    "section": "3. Leveraging a Pretrained Model for CIFAR-10",
    "text": "3. Leveraging a Pretrained Model for CIFAR-10\nResNet50 is known for its high accuracy and relatively efficient parameter count among pretrained models. We should adjust its input dimensions to fit the CIFAR-10 dataset rather than using its default settings. See https://paperswithcode.com/sota/image-classification-on-imagenet to see list of pretrained models and their performance, using ImageNet dataset as benchmark.\nFirst, let’s illustrate a method that is conceptually sound but inefficient for using pretrained models.\n\nResizing layer is added to adjust the image dimensions from the original 32x32 pixels to 224x224 pixels. This step is crucial because ResNet50 was originally trained on the ImageNet dataset, where images have a resolution of 224x224 pixels. By resizing our images to match this resolution, we align them with the input format the model was designed for, ensuring that the features learned from ImageNet are effectively utilized. This alignment helps maintain the integrity of the pretrained model’s architecture and improves its performance on our specific dataset.\nEarly Stopping is employed to enhance training efficiency by halting the training process when the model’s performance ceases to improve on the validation dataset. This prevents unnecessary computations and helps avoid overfitting.\nModelCheckpoint callback is used to save the model’s weights at specific points during training, ensuring that the best-performing model (according to validation metrics) is preserved. This way, if the training process is interrupted or if we need to revert to a previous state, we can load the saved weights and continue from the best checkpoint. Together, these techniques help optimize both the training time and the final performance of the model.\n\n\npretrained_model = ResNet50(input_shape=(224, 224, 3),\n                    include_top=False)\n\npretrained_model.trainable = True\n\nmodel = Sequential([\n          Resizing(224, 224),  # Resize images to 224x224\n            pretrained_model,\n            BatchNormalization(),\n            GlobalAveragePooling2D(),\n            Dense(1024, activation='relu'),\n            Dropout(0.4),\n            Dense(10, activation='softmax', dtype='float32'),\n        ])\n\n# Compile the model with the same optimizer and loss function\nmodel.compile(optimizer='adam',loss='categorical_crossentropy',metrics=['accuracy'])\n\n# Define early stopping parameters\nearly_stopping_patience = 5 # Stop training if no improvement after 5 epochs\nearly_stopping_min_delta = 0.01 # Stop training if improvement is less than 0.01%\n\n# Create EarlyStopping callback object\nearly_stopping = EarlyStopping(monitor='val_loss', patience=early_stopping_patience, min_delta=early_stopping_min_delta)\n\n# Define where to save the best model based on validation accuracy\nbest_model_path = 'best_model.h5'\n\n# Create ModelCheckpoint callback object\nmodel_checkpoint = ModelCheckpoint(best_model_path + '.keras', monitor='val_accuracy', mode='max', verbose=1, save_best_only=True)\n# Continue training from the last saved model\nmodel.fit(train_set,\n        epochs=50,\n        batch_size=64,\n        validation_data=validation_set, shuffle=True,callbacks=[early_stopping, model_checkpoint])\n\n# Evaluate final model on test set\nloss, acc = best_model.evaluate(x_test, y_test, verbose=1)\n\nprint('Test loss:', loss)\nprint('Test acc:', acc)\n\n\n\n\nWe achieved a high test score of 0.898, but the question remains: is this the best way to use transfer learning?\nTo determine if our approach to transfer learning is correct, we first need to understand the principles behind it. Transfer learning is designed to enhance efficiency and reduce computational costs by leveraging pretrained models. Instead of retraining a model from scratch, we use an existing model that has already been trained on a large dataset. This typically involves “freezing” the earlier layers of the model, which means keeping their weights unchanged, and only training the final layers on our specific dataset. This strategy allows us to build on the learned features of the pretrained model, thus saving time and computational resources while potentially achieving better performance with less data.\nIn the case above, we had set pretrained_model.trainable = True which we should have set to False to fully leverage the full benefits of a pretrained model.\n\nA Better way to utilise a pretrained model: Firstly, instead of incorporating a resizing layer within the model, we should resize our images to 224x224 pixels during the preprocessing step.\n\nCan you think of the rationale for this?\n\n\nTo be Continued….."

    "section": "Overview",
    "text": "Overview\nIn the era of digital urbanization, city-wide infrastructures, encompassing transportation modes like buses, taxis, and mass transit, have undergone significant digitization. This transformation has yielded extensive datasets that serve as a fundamental framework for monitoring movement patterns across both space and time. This shift is particularly evident with the widespread adoption of pervasive computing technologies, including GPS and RFID, notably integrated into vehicles. For instance, the utilization of smart cards and GPS devices on public buses enables the collection of comprehensive data on routes and ridership. Within these vast datasets lie inherent structures and patterns that offer valuable insights into the characteristics of measured phenomena, providing a deeper understanding of human movement and behaviors within urban environments. The identification, analysis, and comparison of these patterns present opportunities for enhanced urban management, offering valuable information for both public and private urban transport service providers. Despite these possibilities, current practices often restrict the use of massive locational data to basic tracking and mapping through Geographic Information System (GIS) applications. This limitation arises from the insufficient capabilities of conventional GIS in effectively analyzing and modeling spatial and spatio-temporal data."

The “grid_id” values are assigned incrementally, starting from 1 and corresponding to the order of the hexagons in the grid. This step essentially assigns a unique identifier to each hexagon in the grid, facilitating further spatial analysis or mapping.\n\n\nShow the code\nhexagon = st_make_grid(busstop, c(250, 250), what = \"polygons\", square = FALSE)\n\n# To sf and add grid ID\nhexagon_sf = st_sf(hexagon) %&gt;%\n  # add grid ID\n  mutate(grid_id = 1:length(lengths(hexagon)))\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\nduplicates &lt;- hexagon_sf[duplicated(hexagon_sf$grid_id), ]\n\n# Check if there are any duplicates\nif (nrow(duplicates) &gt; 0) {\n  cat(\"Duplicate values found in the grid_id column.\\n\")\n  print(duplicates)\n} else {\n  cat(\"No duplicate values found in the grid_id column.\\n\")\n}\n\n\nNo duplicate values found in the grid_id column.\n\n\n\n\nExamine The Grid\nA brief overplot shows that there are 22134 grids in total and 19003 are without bus stops.

We specify break points at 0,1,2,3,4 and 5\nFrom the map below, it is obvious that most hexagons have 1 or 2 bus stops in their grid with some having 4 or 5 bus stops. There is approximately one ‘cluster’ that are close to each other and having 4 or 5 bus stops in each region in North, East, South, West.\n\n\nShow the code\ntmap_mode(\"plot\")\n\n\ntmap mode set to plotting\n\n\nShow the code\nmap_busstopcounts = tm_shape(hexagon_sf) +\n  tm_fill(\n    col = \"n_colli\",\n    palette = c(\"grey\",rev(viridis(5))),\n    breaks = c(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5),\n    title = \"Number of Busstops\",\n    id = \"grid_id\",\n    showNA = FALSE,\n    alpha = 0.6,\n    popup.vars = c(\n      \"Number of collisions: \" = \"n_colli\"\n    ),\n    popup.format = list(\n      n_colli = list(format = \"f\", digits = 0)\n    )\n  ) +\n  tm_borders(col = \"grey40\", lwd = 0.7)\n\nmap_busstopcounts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA few notable findings were:\n\nIn the North-West, bus stops are scarce around the cemetery in Choa Chu Kang, the nearest bus stops in that area are those along Lim Chu Kang road. Tengah Airbase is also located in that area.\nAt the far East, bus stops are scarce around Changi Airport\n- “grid_id” = 22027 is an extreme outlier, we will need to drop it\nTowards the middle, we have Paya Lebar Airbase\nIn the middle, we have the Central Water Catchment\nA standalone bus stop in Sentosa Island\n- “grid_id” = 11471 is a potential outlier and should be considered for exclusion\nA few bus stops in Johor are surprisingly in our dataset too and in\n- “grid_id” = 7068 is an extreme outlier, we will need to drop it.\n- “grid_id” for 8113,8237,8351,8485 are potential outliers as well\nOther than those mentioned above, the positioning of the rest of the bus stops seem to be acceptable and will not skew our dataset too much.\n\n\n\nData Cleaning\nHence, let’s proceed straight to dropping these data that will likely cause problems for our analysis. After deeper consideration, we decided that we should drop grid_ids for 22027, 11471 and 7068\n\n\nShow the code\n# Combine Busstop and Hexagon\nhexagon_sf &lt;- hexagon_sf %&gt;%\n  filter(!grid_id %in% c(22027, 11471, 7068))\n\n\n\n\n\nWe needed to perform aggregation of passenger trips by Hexagon instead of Origin Bus Stop, hence we need to first integrate bus stop data and the hexagon dataset using the st_intersection function from the sf package. The intersection operation retains only the spatial elements (points) that overlap between the original bus stop locations and the hexagonal grid.The resulting busstop_hexagon dataset contains information about which hexagon grid each bus stop is located in.\n\n\nShow the code\n# Combine Busstop and Hexagon\nbusstop_hexagon &lt;- st_intersection(busstop, hexagon_sf) %&gt;%\n  select(BUS_STOP_N, grid_id) %&gt;%\n  st_drop_geometry\n\n\nWarning: attribute variables are assumed to be spatially constant throughout\nall geometries\n\n\nHowever, it is found that there is still one duplicate found despite the thorough cleaning we did earlier:\n- Some bus stops were found to be in multiple grids, this is illogical and should be dropped from analysis.\n-   Example: BUS_STOP 250559 appeared both in grid 4 and 128\n\n\nShow the code\nduplicate &lt;- busstop_hexagon %&gt;%\n  group_by(BUS_STOP_N) %&gt;%\n  filter(n()&gt;1) %&gt;%\n  ungroup()\nduplicate\n\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 2\n  BUS_STOP_N grid_id\n  &lt;chr&gt;        &lt;int&gt;\n1 25059            4\n2 25059          128\n\n\nThus, the following preprocessing steps needs to be done:\n\nfilter out bus stops that have multiple grid_ids\n\nThe output now shows that we have successful dealt with duplicates and erroneous data from the integration .\n\n\nShow the code\nbusstop_hexagon &lt;- busstop_hexagon %&gt;%\n  group_by(BUS_STOP_N) %&gt;%\n  filter(n_distinct(grid_id)==1) %&gt;%\n  ungroup()\n\nduplicate &lt;- busstop_hexagon %&gt;%\n  group_by(BUS_STOP_N) %&gt;%\n  filter(n()&gt;1) %&gt;%\n  ungroup()\nduplicate\n\n\n# A tibble: 0 × 2\n# ℹ 2 variables: BUS_STOP_N &lt;chr&gt;, grid_id &lt;int&gt;\n\n\nNext, we sum up the total passenger trips group by each hexagon grid as ORIGIN_GRID for the 4 dataframes seperately to get the resulting tibble dataframes.\n\nweekday_morning_peak_join_list &lt;- left_join(weekday_morning_peak , busstop_hexagon,\n            by = c(\"ORIGIN_PT_CODE\" = \"BUS_STOP_N\")) %&gt;%\n  rename(ORIGIN_BS = ORIGIN_PT_CODE, ORIGIN_GRID = grid_id) %&gt;%\n  group_by(ORIGIN_GRID) %&gt;%\n  summarise(TOT_TRIPS = sum(TRIPS))\n\n\n\nweekday_afternoon_peak_join_list &lt;- left_join(weekday_afternoon_peak , busstop_hexagon,\n            by = c(\"ORIGIN_PT_CODE\" = \"BUS_STOP_N\")) %&gt;%\n  rename(ORIGIN_BS = ORIGIN_PT_CODE, ORIGIN_GRID = grid_id) %&gt;%\n  group_by(ORIGIN_GRID) %&gt;%\n  summarise(TOT_TRIPS = sum(TRIPS))\n\n\n\nweekend_morning_peak_join_list &lt;- left_join(weekend_morning_peak , busstop_hexagon,\n            by = c(\"ORIGIN_PT_CODE\" = \"BUS_STOP_N\")) %&gt;%\n  rename(ORIGIN_BS = ORIGIN_PT_CODE, ORIGIN_GRID = grid_id) %&gt;%\n  group_by(ORIGIN_GRID) %&gt;%\n  summarise(TOT_TRIPS = sum(TRIPS))\n\n\n\nweekend_evening_peak_join_list &lt;- left_join(weekend_evening_peak , busstop_hexagon,\n            by = c(\"ORIGIN_PT_CODE\" = \"BUS_STOP_N\")) %&gt;%\n  rename(ORIGIN_BS = ORIGIN_PT_CODE, ORIGIN_GRID = grid_id) %&gt;%\n  group_by(ORIGIN_GRID) %&gt;%\n  summarise(TOT_TRIPS = sum(TRIPS))\n\nAfter that is done, we have to join back with our sf dataset using grid_id.\nThis code chunk below performs several operations to analyze the total number of trips (TOT_TRIPS) during weekday morning peak hours based on the origin bus stop and its corresponding hexagonal grid instead of its previous bus stop number we are using.\n\n\nShow the code\nweekday_morning_peak_join_geometry &lt;- left_join(hexagon_sf, \n                           weekday_morning_peak_join_list,\n                           by = c(\"grid_id\" = \"ORIGIN_GRID\"))\n\nweekday_afternoon_peak_join_geometry &lt;- left_join(hexagon_sf, \n                           weekday_afternoon_peak_join_list,\n                           by = c(\"grid_id\" = \"ORIGIN_GRID\"))\n\nweekend_morning_peak_join_geometry &lt;- left_join(hexagon_sf, \n                           weekend_morning_peak_join_list,\n                           by = c(\"grid_id\" = \"ORIGIN_GRID\"))\n\nweekend_evening_peak_join_geometry &lt;- left_join(hexagon_sf, \n                           weekend_evening_peak_join_list,\n                           by = c(\"grid_id\" = \"ORIGIN_GRID\"))\n\nwrite_rds(weekday_morning_peak_join_geometry, \"data/rds/weekday_morning_peak_join_geometry.rds\")\nweekday_morning_peak_join_geometry &lt;- read_rds(\"data/rds/weekday_morning_peak_join_geometry.rds\")\n\nwrite_rds(weekday_afternoon_peak_join_geometry, \"data/rds/weekday_afternoon_peak_join_geometry.rds\")\nweekday_afternoon_peak_join_geometry &lt;- read_rds(\"data/rds/weekday_afternoon_peak_join_geometry.rds\")\n\nwrite_rds(weekend_morning_peak_join_geometry, \"data/rds/weekend_morning_peak_join_geometry.rds\")\nweekend_morning_peak &lt;- read_rds(\"data/rds/weekend_morning_peak.rds\")\n\nwrite_rds(weekend_evening_peak_join_geometry, \"data/rds/weekend_evening_peak_join_geometry.rds\")\nweekend_evening_peak_join_geometry &lt;- read_rds(\"data/rds/weekend_evening_peak_join_geometry.rds\")"

    "text": "4. Geovisualisation and Analysis\n\nImportant Considerations\n\nDue to the use of small hexagon tiles and a heavily right skewed distribution, quantile classification proves to provide little value. We decided that kmeans classification is best due to the ability to create discrete classes. This helps us to compare the 4 periods easily.\nWe previously derived number of Passenger Trips using the bus stops as the origin. This means that that some tiles could have missing data due to the lack of trips originating from there but that not necessary be the case for trips with that as the destination.\nWe previously excluded tiles with no bus stops earlier in hexagon_sf, hence any missing data present here is not due to missing bus stops\n\n\n\nGeneral Observations across all 4 interval classifications\n\nThe bus stops along Lim Chu Kang exhibit minimal to no origin trips on both weekdays and weekends. This can be attributed to the presence of a cemetery in that area, making it more practical for individuals to use private transportation.\nAdditionally, along the eastern coast, there are several bus stops without origin trips on weekdays. However, the situation changes on weekends and holidays, although the overall volume remains low. It is advisable to consider adjusting the bus schedule in that region for weekdays. A similar pattern is observed for the islands in the North-West..\nOrigin Trips for a few bus stops near the customs remain high through weekdays and wekends. Also, one bus stop in Johor is consistently high in origin trips.\nIn central areas, origin trips are not high during weekday mornings but are high during weekday afternoons. This is probably due to residential planning by the URA where residents travel from the other regions to the central and business districts.\n\n\nWeekday Morning PeakWeekday Afternoon PeakWeekend/holiday Morning PeakWeekend/holiday Evening Peak\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\ntmap_mode(\"plot\")\n\n\ntmap mode set to plotting\n\n\nShow the code\ninferno_palette &lt;- inferno(5)\ntmap_options(check.and.fix = TRUE)\ntm_shape(weekday_morning_peak_join_geometry)+\n  tm_fill(\"TOT_TRIPS\", \n          style = \"kmeans\", \n          palette = viridis(5),\n          title = \"Passenger trips\") +\n  tm_layout(main.title = \"Passenger trips during Weekday morning peak\",\n            main.title.position = \"center\",\n            main.title.size = 1.2,\n            legend.height = 0.45, \n            legend.width = 0.35,\n            frame = TRUE) +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +\n  tm_scale_bar() +\n  tm_grid(alpha =0.2)+\n  tmap_style(\"natural\")\n\n\ntmap style set to \"natural\"\n\n\nother available styles are: \"white\", \"gray\", \"cobalt\", \"col_blind\", \"albatross\", \"beaver\", \"bw\", \"classic\", \"watercolor\" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\ntmap_mode(\"plot\")\n\n\ntmap mode set to plotting\n\n\nShow the code\ntmap_options(check.and.fix = TRUE)\ntm_shape(weekday_afternoon_peak_join_geometry)+\n  tm_fill(\"TOT_TRIPS\", \n          style = \"kmeans\", \n          palette = viridis(5),\n          title = \"Passenger trips\") +\n  tm_layout(main.title = \"Passenger trips during Weekday afternoon peak\",\n            main.title.position = \"center\",\n            main.title.size = 1.2,\n            legend.height = 0.45, \n            legend.width = 0.35,\n            frame = TRUE) +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +\n  tm_scale_bar() +\n  tm_grid(alpha =0.2)+\n  tmap_style(\"natural\")\n\n\ntmap style set to \"natural\"\n\n\nother available styles are: \"white\", \"gray\", \"cobalt\", \"col_blind\", \"albatross\", \"beaver\", \"bw\", \"classic\", \"watercolor\" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\ntmap_mode(\"plot\")\n\n\ntmap mode set to plotting\n\n\nShow the code\ntmap_options(check.and.fix = TRUE)\ntm_shape(weekend_morning_peak_join_geometry)+\n  tm_fill(\"TOT_TRIPS\", \n          style = \"kmeans\", \n          palette = viridis(5),\n          title = \"Passenger trips\") +\n  tm_layout(main.title = \"Passenger trips during Weekend/holiday morning peak\",\n            main.title.position = \"center\",\n            main.title.size = 1.2,\n            legend.height = 0.45, \n            legend.width = 0.35,\n            frame = TRUE) +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +\n  tm_scale_bar() +\n  tm_grid(alpha =0.2)+\n  tmap_style(\"natural\")\n\n\ntmap style set to \"natural\"\n\n\nother available styles are: \"white\", \"gray\", \"cobalt\", \"col_blind\", \"albatross\", \"beaver\", \"bw\", \"classic\", \"watercolor\" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\ntmap_mode(\"plot\")\n\n\ntmap mode set to plotting\n\n\nShow the code\ntmap_options(check.and.fix = TRUE)\ntm_shape(weekend_evening_peak_join_geometry)+\n  tm_fill(\"TOT_TRIPS\", \n          style = \"kmeans\",\n          palette = viridis(5), \n          title = \"Passenger trips\") +\n  tm_layout(main.title = \"Passenger trips during Weekend/holiday evening peak\",\n            main.title.position = \"center\",\n            main.title.size = 1.2,\n            legend.height = 0.45, \n            legend.width = 0.35,\n            frame = TRUE) +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +\n  tm_scale_bar() +\n  tm_grid(alpha =0.2) +\n  tmap_style(\"natural\")\n\n\ntmap style set to \"natural\"\n\n\nother available styles are: \"white\", \"gray\", \"cobalt\", \"col_blind\", \"albatross\", \"beaver\", \"bw\", \"classic\", \"watercolor\""

    "text": "5. Local Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA) Analysis\nLocal Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA) Analysis:\nLocal Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA) is a statistical technique used in spatial analysis to identify and assess spatial patterns of clustering or dispersion within a geographical dataset. LISA analysis helps to uncover local patterns of spatial autocorrelation, providing insights into whether similar values tend to cluster together or if there are areas with dissimilar values.\nLISA analysis is based on the concept of spatial autocorrelation, which measures the degree to which neighboring locations are similar or dissimilar in terms of a particular variable. (In Our case, it is Origin Passenger Trips)\nTwo key LISA statistics are Moran’s I and the associated p-value, for each spatial unit (hexagon grid in our case) to determine if they are part of a significant cluster, outlier, or exhibit no significant pattern.\nLocal Moran’s I identifies clusters by categorizing each unit as High-High (high value surrounded by high values), Low-Low (low value surrounded by low values), High-Low (high value surrounded by low values), or Low-High (low value surrounded by high values).\n- Decision-making process\nDue to the use of hexagon grids, we had many empty grids and this proves difficult to derive contiguity weights. Hence, we attempted to derive distance weights instead\nFixed distance weight matrix was used in deriving the weights and neighbors.\n\n5.1 Deriving adaptive distance weights\nThe summary statistics report below shows that the maximum nearest neighbour distance is 901.4m. By using a threshold value of 902m will ensure that each area will have at least one neighbour.\n\n\nShow the code\ngeo &lt;- sf::st_geometry(hexagon_sf)\nnb &lt;- st_knn(geo, longlat = TRUE)\n\n\n!

Polygon provided. Using point on surface.\n\n\n\n\n5.2 Computing local Moran’s I\nIn this section, we will compute Local Moran’s I of Total Passenger Trips at county level by using local_moran() of sfdep package.\nThe provided code conducts a Local Moran’s I analysis on four distinct datasets (wm_q_1, wm_q_2, wm_q_3, wm_q_4), each associated with specific time periods or scenarios.\nThe analysis focuses on the spatial autocorrelation of the variable TOT_TRIPS within each dataset, employing the local_moran function with\n\nneighbors (nb) and\nweights (wt) and\n99 simulations.\n\nThe calculated Local Moran’s I statistic assesses whether nearby observations exhibit similar total trip values, revealing spatial patterns and clusters.\nThe use of unnest implies a need to extract detailed information about the spatial relationships between observations and their neighbors after the Local Moran’s I analysis.\n\n\nShow the code\nlisa_1 &lt;- wm_q_1 %&gt;% \n  mutate(local_moran = local_moran(\n    TOT_TRIPS, nb, wt, nsim = 99),\n         .before = 1) %&gt;%\n  unnest(local_moran)\n\n\nlisa_2 &lt;- wm_q_2 %&gt;% \n  mutate(local_moran = local_moran(\n    TOT_TRIPS, nb, wt, nsim = 99),\n         .before = 1) %&gt;%\n  unnest(local_moran)\n\n\nlisa_3 &lt;- wm_q_3 %&gt;% \n  mutate(local_moran = local_moran(\n    TOT_TRIPS, nb, wt, nsim = 99),\n         .before = 1) %&gt;%\n  unnest(local_moran)\n\n\nlisa_4 &lt;- wm_q_4 %&gt;% \n  mutate(local_moran = local_moran(\n    TOT_TRIPS, nb, wt, nsim = 99),\n         .before = 1) %&gt;%\n  unnest(local_moran)\n\n\n\n\n5.3 Visualising local Moran’s I\nIn the following code section, tmap functions are utilized to create a choropleth map based on the values in the ii field, representing the Local Moran’s I values. The chosen tmap_style option is set to albatross to suit the grid’s nature and emphasize clusters, where lighter colors indicate positive values and darker colors indicate negative values.\nIt’s important to note that a positive Local Moran’s I value signifies a feature’s membership in a cluster, while a negative value suggests that a feature is an outlier.\nExamining the map, regions shaded in various hues of green indicate their membership in one or more clusters.While there are overlapping areas among the maps generated for the four periods of interest, there are also discrepancies.\nHowever, relying solely on the local Moran’s score is insufficient for depicting spatial clustering, as it doesn’t provide information about whether the variable’s value (Total Passenger Trips) being examined is high or low, and whether the test result is statistically significant. We need to proceed with analyzing only the regions with statistically significant values of total passenger trips.\n\n5.3.1 Weekday Morning Peak5.3.2 Weekday Afternoon Peak5.3.3 Weekend Morning Peak5.3.4 Weekend Afternoon Peak\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\ntmap_mode(\"plot\")\n\n\ntmap mode set to plotting\n\n\nShow the code\ntm_shape(lisa_1) +\n  tm_fill(\"ii\",\n          style = \"kmeans\",\n         palette = viridis(5)) + \n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +\n  tm_layout(main.title = \"local Moran I of Bus Trips in weekday morning\",\n            main.title.size = 0.8) +\n  tmap_style(\"albatross\")\n\n\ntmap style set to \"albatross\"\n\n\nother available styles are: \"white\", \"gray\", \"natural\", \"cobalt\", \"col_blind\", \"beaver\", \"bw\", \"classic\", \"watercolor\" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\ntmap_mode(\"plot\")\n\n\ntmap mode set to plotting\n\n\nShow the code\ntm_shape(lisa_2) +\n  tm_fill(\"ii\",\n          style = \"kmeans\",\n         palette = viridis(5)) + \n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +\n  tm_layout(main.title = \"local Moran I of Bus Trips in weekday afternoon\",\n            main.title.size = 0.8) +\n  tmap_style(\"albatross\")\n\n\ntmap style set to \"albatross\"\n\n\nother available styles are: \"white\", \"gray\", \"natural\", \"cobalt\", \"col_blind\", \"beaver\", \"bw\", \"classic\", \"watercolor\" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\ntmap_mode(\"plot\")\n\n\ntmap mode set to plotting\n\n\nShow the code\ntm_shape(lisa_3) +\n  tm_fill(\"ii\",\n          style = \"kmeans\",\n         palette = viridis(5)) + \n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +\n  tm_layout(main.title = \"local Moran I of Bus Trips in weekend morning\",\n            main.title.size = 0.8) +\n  tmap_style(\"albatross\")\n\n\ntmap style set to \"albatross\"\n\n\nother available styles are: \"white\", \"gray\", \"natural\", \"cobalt\", \"col_blind\", \"beaver\", \"bw\", \"classic\", \"watercolor\" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\ntmap_mode(\"plot\")\n\n\ntmap mode set to plotting\n\n\nShow the code\ntm_shape(lisa_4) +\n  tm_fill(\"ii\",\n          style = \"kmeans\",\n         palette = viridis(5)) + \n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +\n  tm_layout(main.title = \"local Moran I of Bus Trips in weekend afternoon\",\n            main.title.size = 0.8) +\n  tmap_style(\"albatross\")\n\n\ntmap style set to \"albatross\"\n\n\nother available styles are: \"white\", \"gray\", \"natural\", \"cobalt\", \"col_blind\", \"beaver\", \"bw\", \"classic\", \"watercolor\" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4 Visualising p-value of local Moran’s I\nIn the code chunk below, tmap functions are used to prepare a choropleth map by using value in the p_ii_sim field\nWe will visualize solely the statistically significant local Moran’s I values (p_ii_sim &lt; 0.05) through the subsequent code snippet.\n\n5.4.1 Weekday Morning Peak5.4.2 Weekday Afternoon Peak5.4.3 Weekend Morning Peak5.4.4 Weekend Afternoon Peak\n\n\nComparing local Moran’s I together with its p_ii_sim values, a few observations were revealed:\n\nThere are clusters near customs and throughout most of west area. They are all statistically significant.\nClusters and dispersions found in the South / Central are mostly not statistically significant and should be ignored.\nThere are both many clusters and dispersions found in Bedok, Tampines, Pasir Ris and Changi that are found to be statistically significant. However, not so much for other parts of East.\nClusters and Dispersions found in North east and North are also statistically significant.\n\nThese Clusters found seem to match our expectations as they are within residential zones. However, this is possible also because of bus interchanges and the wider options of buses avaliable near these bus interchanges.\nWhat about the dispersion that we are observing? It is easy to dismiss that. However they tend to happen around those clusters found. This can actually be explained with the fact that are OTHER options other than taking buses such as a little bit of walk or…. Cycling!!! as a form of commuting.\nThis trend may not be immediately apparent to individuals who don’t utilize public transportation or to foreigners. However, it’s becoming increasingly common for Singaporeans to use personal transport, such as bicycles, to reach bus interchanges instead of waiting for buses directly at their residences. This choice is driven by the realization that cycling to the bus interchange can be a more time-efficient option. The areas surrounding bus interchanges often face congestion with numerous bus stops and traffic lights, turning what should be a short journey into a lengthy one.\n\n\nShow the code\ntmap_mode(\"plot\")\n\n\ntmap mode set to plotting\n\n\nShow the code\ntm_shape(lisa_1) +\n  tm_fill(\"p_ii_sim\",\n          palette = c(rev(viridis(5)), \"grey\"),\n          breaks = c(0, 0.001, 0.01, 0.05, 1),\n          labels = c(\"0.001\", \"0.01\", \"0.05\", \"Not sig\")) + \n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +\n  tm_layout(main.title = \"p-value of local Moran I in weekday morning\",\n            main.title.size = 0.8) +\n  tmap_style(\"watercolor\")\n\n\ntmap style set to \"watercolor\"\n\n\nother available styles are: \"white\", \"gray\", \"natural\", \"cobalt\", \"col_blind\", \"albatross\", \"beaver\", \"bw\", \"classic\" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are few dispersions this time round and more clusters found instead.\nMost of previously residential areas identified are found to not display any statistically significant patterns, other than some parts around tampines and north east which could be hubs designated by the government.\nMany statistically significant clusters are found around west region which is also an industrial region.\nCentral business district areas do not exhibit any significant patterns, it seems most office workers do not take buses home but the MRT instead.\n\n\nShow the code\ntmap_mode(\"plot\")\n\n\ntmap mode set to plotting\n\n\nShow the code\ntm_shape(lisa_2) +\n  tm_fill(\"p_ii_sim\",\n          palette = c(rev(viridis(5)), \"grey\"),\n          breaks = c(0, 0.001, 0.01, 0.05, 1),\n          labels = c(\"0.001\", \"0.01\", \"0.05\", \"Not sig\")) + \n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +\n  tm_layout(main.title = \"p-value of local Moran I in weekday afternoon\",\n            main.title.size = 0.8) +\n  tmap_style(\"watercolor\")\n\n\ntmap style set to \"watercolor\"\n\n\nother available styles are: \"white\", \"gray\", \"natural\", \"cobalt\", \"col_blind\", \"albatross\", \"beaver\", \"bw\", \"classic\" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt seems there are more dispersions during mornings peak hours even for weekends/holidays.\nThere are less clusters as compared to weekdays.
