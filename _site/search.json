    "text": "What are the driving forces behind urban dwellers to weak up early in morning to commute from their home locations to their work places? What are the impact of removing a public bus service on the commuters reside along the corridor of the bus route? These and many other questions related to urban mobility are challenges faced by transport operators and urban managers.\nTo provide answer to this question, traditionally, commuters survey will be used. However, commuters survey is a very costly, time-consuming and laborous, not to mention that the survey data tend to take a long time to clean and analyse. As a result, it is not unusual, by the time the survey report was ready, most of the information already out-of-date!\nAs city-wide urban infrastructures such as public buses, mass rapid transits, public utilities and roads become digital, the data sets obtained can be used as a framework for tracking movement patterns through space and time. This is particularly true with the recent trend of massive deployment of pervasive computing technologies such as GPS on the vehicles and SMART cards used by public transport commuters.\nUnfortunately, this explosive growth of geospatially-referenced data has far outpaced the planner’s ability to utilize and transform the data into insightful information thus creating an adverse impact on the return on the investment made to collect and manage this data."

The absence of labels, compounded by the use of a violin plot that highlights distribution, adds to the complexity.\n\n“…Noteworthy is the discernible uptick in both unit price and transaction volume from January to March 2024…”\n\nTransaction volume is particularly challenging to discern compared to unit price because the y-axis is focused on describing unit prices.\n\n“…Despite an overall reduction in total transactions vis-a-vis the preceding year, there is an unmistakable trend towards growth within specific sub-markets, suggesting an increasing inclination towards higher-value properties…”\n\nThe x-axis represents the three months of Q1 2024 instead of displaying transaction volume, a metric frequently referenced by the author. Utilizing the x-axis to depict transaction volume would enhance clarity significantly..\n\nOther concerns:\nThe title provides a general description but lacks specificity. It does not specify the time period covered by the visualization, nor does it offer insight into the context or main focus of the visualization. A more detailed title and subtitle would enhance clarity and understanding for the audience.\nThe x-axis represents the three months of Q1 2024 instead of displaying transaction volume, a metric frequently referenced by the author. Utilizing the x-axis to depict transaction volume would enhance clarity significantly.\n\n\n\n2.2.2 Aesthetics\n\nThe color selection is problematic due to the light-colored background, which matches the hue of the violin plot. This makes it strenuous for the eyes to distinguish between elements.\nFonts, titles, x-ticks, and legends are small and difficult to discern."

In this case, the use of a violin plot is worse as the writer intends to make several comparisons that are not obvious from said plot.\nThis scenario seems appropriate for a similar makeover done by Michael Djohan for another student.\nAcknowledging that point plots may distract and add little value, we omitted them. Instead, a modified bar chart resembling a violin plot was adopted. This alternative retains the visual appeal of a violin plot while providing clearer and more informative comparisons. We also decided to add annotations for median prices and transaction volume. A facet plot is used to distinctively compare between the three months for Q1 2024."

    "text": "What are the driving forces behind urban dwellers to weak up early in morning to commute from their home locations to their work places? What are the impact of removing a public bus service on the commuters reside along the corridor of the bus route? These and many other questions related to urban mobility are challenges faced by transport operators and urban managers.\nTo provide answer to this question, traditionally, commuters survey will be used. However, commuters survey is a very costly, time-consuming and laborous, not to mention that the survey data tend to take a long time to clean and analyse. As a result, it is not unusual, by the time the survey report was ready, most of the information already out-of-date!\nAs city-wide urban infrastructures such as public buses, mass rapid transits, public utilities and roads become digital, the data sets obtained can be used as a framework for tracking movement patterns through space and time. This is particularly true with the recent trend of massive deployment of pervasive computing technologies such as GPS on the vehicles and SMART cards used by public transport commuters.\nUnfortunately, this explosive growth of geospatially-referenced data has far outpaced the planner’s ability to utilize and transform the data into insightful information thus creating an adverse impact on the return on the investment made to collect and manage this data."

The absence of labels, compounded by the use of a violin plot that highlights distribution, adds to the complexity.\n\n“…Noteworthy is the discernible uptick in both unit price and transaction volume from January to March 2024…”\n\nTransaction volume is particularly challenging to discern compared to unit price because the y-axis is focused on describing unit prices.\n\n“…Despite an overall reduction in total transactions vis-a-vis the preceding year, there is an unmistakable trend towards growth within specific sub-markets, suggesting an increasing inclination towards higher-value properties…”\n\nThe x-axis represents the three months of Q1 2024 instead of displaying transaction volume, a metric frequently referenced by the author. Utilizing the x-axis to depict transaction volume would enhance clarity significantly..\n\nOther concerns:\nThe title provides a general description but lacks specificity. It does not specify the time period covered by the visualization, nor does it offer insight into the context or main focus of the visualization. A more detailed title and subtitle would enhance clarity and understanding for the audience.\nThe x-axis represents the three months of Q1 2024 instead of displaying transaction volume, a metric frequently referenced by the author. Utilizing the x-axis to depict transaction volume would enhance clarity significantly.\n\n\n\n2.2.2 Aesthetics\n\nThe color selection is problematic due to the light-colored background, which matches the hue of the violin plot. This makes it strenuous for the eyes to distinguish between elements.\nFonts, titles, x-ticks, and legends are small and difficult to discern."

In this case, the use of a violin plot is worse as the writer intends to make several comparisons that are not obvious from said plot.\nThis scenario seems appropriate for a similar makeover done by Michael Djohan for another student.\nAcknowledging that point plots may distract and add little value, we omitted them. Instead, a modified bar chart resembling a violin plot was adopted. This alternative retains the visual appeal of a violin plot while providing clearer and more informative comparisons. We also decided to add annotations for median prices and transaction volume. A facet plot is used to distinctively compare between the three months for Q1 2024."

What are the impact of removing a public bus service on the commuters reside along the corridor of the bus route? These and many other questions related to urban mobility are challenges faced by transport operators and urban managers.\nTo provide answer to this question, traditionally, commuters survey will be used. However, commuters survey is a very costly, time-consuming and laborous, not to mention that the survey data tend to take a long time to clean and analyse. As a result, it is not unusual, by the time the survey report was ready, most of the information already out-of-date!\nAs city-wide urban infrastructures such as public buses, mass rapid transits, public utilities and roads become digital, the data sets obtained can be used as a framework for tracking movement patterns through space and time. This is particularly true with the recent trend of massive deployment of pervasive computing technologies such as GPS on the vehicles and SMART cards used by public transport commuters.\nUnfortunately, this explosive growth of geospatially-referenced data has far outpaced the planner’s ability to utilize and transform the data into insightful information thus creating an adverse impact on the return on the investment made to collect and manage this data."
